To summarize the previous section, smart cities started off as initiatives that harnessed digital and IT technology for certain objectives—for efficient energy management in the case of Japan, for citizen-led solutions in the case of Europe, and for more efficient urban development in the case of China and India (along with other Asian countries other than Japan).',\n",
